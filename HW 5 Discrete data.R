#Uncertainty? What does it mean?

# Likelihood estimates:
anc.ml <- ancestral.pml(pml(tree, cleanded.discrete.phy), type = "ml")

#How do parsimony and likelihood differ?
# Likelihood seeks to find tree topology that confers on the highest probability on the observed traits of tip species 
# Parsimony seeks to find the tree topology that requires the fewest changes in trait states to produce the tip species

#Why do they differ? 

#Biological questions about the data using the package corHMM:
#Estimate the transitions between states

# How could you examine if transitions rates are equal?

# Go back to the Lewis, 2001 article and the MKV model (also, think about the Harmon example)
 # Are traits variable?
  #Will this make sense for your data?
  # Test using the different methods and do results change?
  #How could you test the order of state evolution?
